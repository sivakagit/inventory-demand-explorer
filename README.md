# Supply Chain Demand EDA

This project is an open exploration of the **DataCo Supply Chain dataset**.  
The main idea is to understand how products move through the supply chain — from order to delivery — and how different factors like price, lead time, and region affect sales and performance.

It’s not just about cleaning data or building models, but about discovering patterns that make sense in the real world.  
I’ll be going through data cleaning, feature engineering, and analysis to turn this raw dataset into something meaningful and ready for deeper modeling later.

The goal is to treat this like a real-world case: figuring out what the data says about business operations and how we can use those insights to predict and improve demand and delivery outcomes.

This repo will grow as the project moves forward, from exploration to modeling and visualization.

Got it. Here’s a **clean, complete “Setup Instructions” section** you can copy directly into your README:

````markdown
## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Miniconda
Download and install Miniconda for Python 3.10 from [Miniconda Official](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

### Step 2: Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
````

### Step 3: Create a Conda Environment

Create a dedicated environment for this project with Python 3.10:

```bash
conda create -n inventory_env python=3.10 -y
conda activate inventory_env
```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

Install all required packages using `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 5: Verify Setup

Run a Jupyter notebook to confirm that all packages are installed correctly:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### Step 6: Manage the Conda Environment

**Deactivate environment:**

```bash
conda deactivate
```

**Reactivate environment:**

```bash
conda activate inventory_env
```

**Remove the environment (if needed):**

```bash
conda remove -n inventory_env --all
```

```

This covers **all steps from environment creation to verification and management**, ready to paste into your README.
